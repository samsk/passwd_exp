SHADOW DATABASE -
-----------------
	There were some questions about some shadow file internals, so
  here something about it (or try `man shadow'):
  Shadow file records looks like:
name:password:change_last:change_may:change_must:change_warn:inactive_max:expire_date
  
  name		- name
  password 	- password
  change_last	- time user last changed his/her password
  change_may	- minimum time before user can change his/her password
  change_must	- maximum time user doesn't need to change the password
		  if he will not change it. It might get locked or account
		  can get in to the inactivation stage.
  change_warn	- time before user password expiration, the system will
		  warn the user to change his/her password
  inactive_max	- maximum time, account can stay inactive, after user has not
		  changed his/her password, before it gets locked.
		  If 0 or not set, account gets never locked.
  expire_date	- date account will be locked (ie. commercial accounts)


-------------------
  * All times are in the form of the days since the Epoch (little info:
	no warning software takes care about the leap years !!!
	This can be a problem in some hundreds of year when leap years day
	problem will be significantly visible :)))

	I call this `LINUX SHADOW LEAP YEARS BUG' (SLYB), be AWARE !!! :)
