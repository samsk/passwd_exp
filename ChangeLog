	* passwd_exp 0.5.0 (devel - complete rewrite):
	  - this is first(?) complete rewrite of this program
	  - there wan an idea to do this program in python, but
	    there are several reasons why to dont do it. The 
	    first is that perl can found even on the old VMS machines
	    and the second is that python is too organized ;-)
